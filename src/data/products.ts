Best used after cleansing and before serums or moisturizers.`

    description: `Sunout Mist – Protective Skin Shield\n\nIngredients:\nAqua (Water), Lavender Extract, Zinc Oxide\n\nPurpose:\nSunout Mist is more than a sunscreen—it's your skin's environmental armor. Zinc oxide forms a gentle, invisible layer on the skin that reflects harmful UVA/UVB rays and shields against urban toxins, pollution, and grime. Lavender extract soothes inflammation and refreshes the skin, making it suitable for all-day use.\n\nZinc oxide is one of the only two scientifically recognized sun protection ingredients—along with titanium dioxide—that do not disrupt hormones or carry carcinogenic risks, making them ideal for clean, conscious skincare.\n\nHow to Use:\nShake well and mist directly onto clean skin, holding the bottle at arm's length. Pat lightly to set, and reapply every 2–3 hours if exposed to sunlight.`

It helps alkalize the body, regulate blood pressure, and enhance cellular hydration.\n\nHow to Use:\n\nInternal Use: Add a pinch to your morning water to support hydration and mineral intake.\n\nCulinary Use: Use as a finishing salt for salads, vegetables, soups, or any dish for a deeper, earthy flavor.\n\nExternal Use: Add to bath water for a therapeutic, mineral-rich soak to ease tired muscles and detoxify skin.\n\nNote: Store in a dry, non-metallic container to preserve its natural moisture and mineral content.`
